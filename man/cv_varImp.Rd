\title{Extract variable importance from outer CV caret models}
\usage{
cv_varImp(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{nestcv.train} fitted object}
}
\value{
matrix of variable importance from outer CV fold caret models as well
as the final model. Variable importance for variables which are not present
in a particular outer CV fold model is set to 0.
}
\description{
Extracts variable importance or coefficients from outer CV glmnet models from
a \code{nestcv.train} fitted object.
}
\details{
Note that \code{\link[caret:varImp]{caret::varImp()}} may require the model package to be fully loaded
in order to function. During the fitting process \code{caret} often only loads the
package by namespace.
